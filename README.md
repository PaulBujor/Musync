# Musync

A CLI tool that syncs your saved Spotify albums into a queue playlist, and can import playlists from other music services.

Run it on demand — albums you save funnel into the queue; tracks you like or manually remove stay out going forward.

## Features

- **One-shot sync** — runs, logs a summary, exits. No scheduler, no daemon.
- **Liked-track exclusion** — tracks you liked on Spotify are removed from the queue and excluded from future runs.
- **Manual-removal tracking** — remove a track from the playlist manually and it won't be re-added.
- **Idempotent** — re-running is safe. Already-processed albums are skipped; already-seen tracks are never duplicated.
- **Cross-platform import** — import playlists from other providers (e.g. Tidal) into your Spotify queue.
- **Docker or bare-metal** — works with `dotnet run` or `docker compose up`.

## Prerequisites

1. A [Spotify Developer App](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard) with scopes `user-library-read`, `playlist-modify-public` (or `playlist-modify-private`), `playlist-read-private`, `playlist-read-collaborative`.
2. A Spotify playlist to use as the queue (grab its ID from the share link — it's the string after `playlist/`).
3. (Optional) A [Tidal Developer App](https://developer.tidal.com/) if importing Tidal playlists.

Redirect URIs are configured per-provider in `appsettings.json` (default: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/callback`).

## Quick Start

### 1. Configure

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in your credentials:

```env
Spotify__ClientId=your-client-id
Spotify__ClientSecret=your-client-secret
Spotify__QueuePlaylistId=your-playlist-id
```

### 2. Run

```bash
# Direct (pass the command after --)
dotnet run --project src/Musync -- spotify queue-albums

# Docker
docker compose up
```

On first run, your browser opens for OAuth. After authorising, the tool proceeds with the sync.

## Commands

The CLI is organised by provider. Each provider supports `queue-albums` (sync saved albums to its queue playlist) and `import` (pull tracks from another provider).

Global options (available on any command):

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--dry-run` | Preview changes without mutating any provider |
| `--limit <n>` | Cap the number of items processed |

### `<provider> queue-albums`

Syncs your saved albums on that provider into its configured queue playlist.

```bash
dotnet run --project src/Musync -- spotify queue-albums
dotnet run --project src/Musync -- tidal queue-albums
```

Runs three steps: snapshot & diff, add new tracks, report. (Token refresh happens transparently in the HTTP pipeline.)

### `<provider> import --source <provider>`

Imports tracks from a source provider into the target provider's queue playlist. Source and target must differ.

```bash
# Import your Tidal collection into the Spotify queue
dotnet run --project src/Musync -- spotify import --source tidal
```

This command:
1. Authenticates with the source provider (PKCE OAuth, browser opens on first run).
2. Fetches tracks from the source.
3. Searches for each track in the target's catalog (by ISRC, then by name+artist).
4. Adds matched tracks to the target's queue playlist.
5. Generates a report of imported, skipped, and unmatched tracks.

### `spotify reconcile-queue`

Removes duplicate tracks from the Spotify queue playlist (keeping one copy of each) and backfills
the track-history ledger so future syncs stay consistent. Use `--dry-run` to preview.

```bash
dotnet run --project src/Musync -- spotify reconcile-queue --dry-run
dotnet run --project src/Musync -- spotify reconcile-queue
```

### Deprecated aliases

`sync` (→ `spotify queue-albums`) and `import-tidal` (→ `spotify import --source tidal`) still work but log a deprecation warning and exit with code `3`.

### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0` | Success |
| `1` | Error or misconfiguration |
| `2` | Cancelled (Ctrl+C / SIGTERM) |
| `3` | A deprecated alias succeeded |

## Authentication

First run uses PKCE OAuth: a browser window opens, you authorise the app, and the refresh token is stored in the database. Subsequent runs use the stored token silently. If a provider rotates the refresh token, it's persisted immediately to the database.

## How It Works

### `queue-albums` command

Each run executes three steps (token refresh happens transparently in the HTTP pipeline):

1. **Snapshot & diff** — fetches the current playlist and your liked tracks. Liked tracks in the queue are removed; tracks removed manually from the queue since the last run are marked as such in history.
2. **Add new tracks** — iterates saved albums, skips already-processed ones, fetches track lists for new albums. Tracks that are liked or have been seen before are skipped; the rest are added to the queue.
3. **Report** — logs a summary to stdout.

### `import` command

Runs three steps:

1. **Fetch & map** — authenticates with the source provider, fetches its tracks, and searches each in the target provider's catalog via the target's `ITrackMapper` (e.g. `SpotifySearchMapper`).
2. **Add to queue** — adds matched tracks to the target's queue playlist using the same dedup logic as `queue-albums`.
3. **Generate report** — summarises imported, skipped, and unmatched tracks.

### Example Output

```
=== Spotify Queue Sync Complete ===
Duration:          00:01:23
Status:            Succeeded
Tracks added:      42
Tracks removed:    6  (4 liked, 2 manual)
Tracks skipped:    318
New albums seen:   3
Queue size:        104
===================================
```

## Configuration

Settings come from `appsettings.json` (checked in, safe defaults) overridden by environment variables (secrets at runtime via `.env` or `docker compose`).

### Database (`Database__*`)

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `Provider` | `Sqlite` | Database provider: `Sqlite` or `Postgres` |

Connection strings are provider-specific:
- `ConnectionStrings__Sqlite` — SQLite file path (e.g. `Data Source=/path/to/musync.db`)
- `ConnectionStrings__Postgres` — PostgreSQL connection string

The database holds your OAuth refresh tokens, **encrypted at rest** via .NET Data Protection. The
encryption keys are kept under your local user profile (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Musync\keys` on Windows,
`~/.local/share/Musync/keys` on Linux/macOS), separate from the database file. Tokens can only be
decrypted on the machine that created them, so don't rely on syncing the database to another
machine (or to cloud storage) to move your setup — re-authenticate on the new machine instead.

### Spotify (`Spotify__*`)

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `ClientId` | — | Spotify app client ID |
| `ClientSecret` | — | Spotify app client secret |
| `QueuePlaylistId` | — | Target playlist ID |
| `RedirectUri` | `http://127.0.0.1:5000/callback` | OAuth redirect URI |
| `ApiBaseUrl` | `https://api.spotify.com/v1/` | Spotify API base URL |
| `AuthUrl` | `https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize` | OAuth authorisation endpoint |
| `TokenUrl` | `https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token` | OAuth token endpoint |
| `Scopes` | `user-library-read playlist-modify-public ...` | OAuth scopes |
| `RequestDelayMs` | `100` | Delay between API requests |
| `MaxRetries` | `3` | HTTP retry count |
| `MaxConcurrentRequests` | `3` | Parallel album track fetches |

### Tidal (`Tidal__*`)

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `ClientId` | — | Tidal app client ID |
| `ClientSecret` | — | Tidal app client secret |
| `QueuePlaylistId` | — | Target playlist ID (for `tidal queue-albums` / imports into Tidal) |
| `RedirectUri` | `http://127.0.0.1:5000/callback` | OAuth redirect URI |
| `ApiBaseUrl` | `https://openapi.tidal.com/v2` | Tidal v2 API base URL. Leave empty to disable Tidal entirely |
| `AuthUrl` | `https://login.tidal.com/authorize` | OAuth authorisation endpoint |
| `TokenUrl` | `https://auth.tidal.com/v1/oauth2/token` | OAuth token endpoint |
| `Scopes` | `collection.read` | OAuth scopes |
| `MaxRetries` | `3` | HTTP retry count |
| `MaxConcurrentRequests` | `3` | Parallel album track fetches |

## Testing

```bash
dotnet test
```

Tests use a real SQLite in-memory database and `LocalMockMusicProvider` — no HTTP calls, no credentials required.
